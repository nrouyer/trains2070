##  Introduction
This all started with a discussion with my elderly daughter, who was working on a prospective project in which France would help welcome more climate migrants by 2070, notably by densifying its rail network to bring more people to the depopulated center of the country.

I've asked something like this to ChatGPT(4o model):
```
Can you generate a fictitious CSV dataset for me, indicating the departure city, departure city zip code, departure city latitude, departure city longitude, arrival city, arrival city zip code, arrival city latitude, arrival city longitude and number of trains per day?
This must be a prediction for 2070 of train journeys in France, where central cities and port cities are better served than now.
```

ChatGPT answered:
```
I have generated a fictitious dataset for the French train network in 2070. You can download the CSV file using the link below.
It includes:
- Departure and arrival cities
- Postal codes, latitudes, and longitudes for each city
- Predicted number of trains per day, with enhanced service for central and port cities.
